# BOOTSTRAP BOILERPLATE AND PICSUM API

## TASK: 

Create a gallery like in the example using BS / JQ / API from Unsplash

## USE: 

=> Bootstrap/Jquery/etc standalone OR "startbootstrap-thumbnail-gallery"
=> Use the API from Unsplash (you can use PICSUM PHOTOS - make it easyer!)
=> Select the images from /list and be creative ("should not be the firsts or lasts")


## EXTRA POINT:

=> Don't waste time and bandwith with big pictures... use 400x300


## WORKFLOW/SOLUTION (at least one of them...):

=> you should google: startbootstrap-thumbnail-gallery

=> you should check Picsum docs first, how to https://picsum.photos/list works and other solution

=> you should check Ajax docs if needed: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax

=> you should check For statement if needed: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp

=> you should use console.log to debug what you're dealing with

=> google is your friend... sometimes
